# ContextKey Privacy Policy

Effective date: February 20, 2026

ContextKey ("we", "our", "us") is built for private, on-device identity and context workflows.

## Summary

- **On-device processing only**: ContextKey processes data locally on your device.
- **No data collection**: We do not collect personal data from you.
- **No analytics**: We do not use analytics SDKs, behavioral tracking, or usage telemetry.
- **No cloud processing**: We do not upload your content to our servers for processing.
- **No third-party ads**: We do not use advertising frameworks.

## Data We Collect

We do not collect data that can identify you.

Specifically, ContextKey does not collect:

- Contact information
- Identifiers
- Location data
- Usage data
- Diagnostics tied to your identity
- User content uploaded to remote servers

## How ContextKey Processes Data

ContextKey performs computation on-device. Any app content you create or process remains on your device unless you explicitly export or share it using system-provided features (for example, iOS Share Sheet actions you initiate).

## Analytics, Tracking, and Advertising

ContextKey does not:

- Track you across apps or websites
- Share data with data brokers
- Use third-party analytics trackers
- Use ad networks or personalized advertising

## Network Use

ContextKey is designed to function without cloud-based data processing. If network access is ever used for operational reasons (for example, app update checks through platform services), we do not use that connectivity to collect or profile personal data.

## Data Retention and Deletion

Because we do not collect your data on our servers, there is no server-side personal data retention by ContextKey.

Any app data stored locally on your device can be removed by:

1. Deleting content within the app (if applicable), or
2. Uninstalling ContextKey, which removes app container data according to iOS behavior.

## Children's Privacy

ContextKey is privacy-preserving by design and does not knowingly collect personal data from children or any users.

## Security

ContextKey uses platform security controls and on-device processing to minimize data exposure risk.

## Changes to This Policy

If we make material changes, we will update this policy and revise the effective date above.

## App Store Privacy Disclosure Alignment

This policy is intended to align with Apple's App Store privacy disclosures where your app indicates **Data Not Collected** and provides a valid Privacy Policy URL in App Store Connect where required.
